### Project: Data Pipeline with DVC and MLFlow for ML

This project demonstrates end to end ml pipeline using DVC for data and model versioning and MLFlow for experiment tracking. The pipeline involves RF classifier on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

The pipeline will log two experiments in dagshub, one for training and another for evaluation (no artifacts)
